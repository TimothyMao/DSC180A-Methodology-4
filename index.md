## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorming

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain was learning about low and high pass filters and then playing around with audio and implementing a slider to control the playback rate of audio.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

Implementing a way to use facial recognition or hand gestures to control the playback speed. An additional project could also be to use EEG brain signals to control the playback speed.

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would have probably tried to focus more on the rewind part of the slider as that was the part that took the most time and was the most tricky to figure out.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I am interested in applying machine learning to the audio playback such as implementing the facial recognition or gesture recognition.
